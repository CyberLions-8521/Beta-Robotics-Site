## Contribution

Instead of building this project on Jekyll, we can use vanilla HTML CSS & JS to create a dynamic and informative website also deployed by GitHub Pages. I believe it is easier to create a custom website this way. Also, the current github pages site seems to be unfinished.

### 5. Serve the website

If you have VSCODE installed, getting a live server extension will redirect you to localhost:5500, where you can run this site for testing purposes. Type http://127.0.0.1:5500/ into your web browser. 

### 6. Resources

There are many ways to familiarize yourself with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, with w3schools being a popular resource.

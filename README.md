## **Contribution**

Instead of building a website using Editor X or Wix, we can use HTML, CSS, & JS to create a dynamic and informative page deployed by GitHub Pages this year. In the long run, I believe it is easier to websites this way: Editor X and Wix use block-based code which is extremely limiting and causes more lag in comparison to HTML, CSS, & JS. 

- These programming languages are very easy to pick up and we have web developers on the FRC team that can teach you!

## **Serve the website**

If you have VSCODE installed, typing npm start will launch a localhost for you. It should be http://127.0.0.1:3000/ your web browser. 

## **Important**

The newest version of the cyberlions website is built with ReactJS as its foundation. A couple things to know:

- Before editing the webpage, you should have a strong understanding of <ins>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</ins> in general
- ReactJS is a **JavaScript** framework (made by Facebook) that allows you to reuse HTML code
- **You don't have to code to contribute!** UI/UX designers are also welcome to contribute feature designs

There are many ways to familiarize yourself with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, with w3schools being a popular resource. 

**If you're programming in react, clone the repository and run ```npm install react-scripts --save```. This is a dependency that allows you to run the website locally using ```npm start```.**

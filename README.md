## Contribution

Instead of building a website using Editor X or Wix, we can use vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS to create a dynamic and informative page deployed by GitHub Pages this year. In the long run, I believe it is easier to websites this way: Editor X and Wix use block-based code which is extremely limiting and causes more lag in comparison to HTML, CSS, & JS. 

These programming languages are very easy to pick up and we have web developers on the FRC team that can teach you!

**Note:** Currently the github pages API is being used by https://code.whscyberlions.com/, a website that uses Jekyll and Ruby. However, this is an unfinished project. 

### Serve the website

If you have VSCODE installed, getting a live server extension will redirect you to localhost:5500, where you can run this site for testing purposes. Type http://127.0.0.1:5500/ into your web browser. 


### To Do List 

- Media Queries
- Links redirect
- Content: About Robot (2023), Resources, Gallery, Contacts
- Intersection observer fix wrapper from moving

### Resources
